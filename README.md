## Project Overview
In this project, we explore and analyze a dataset containing simulated shopping behaviors. The project is implemented in Python and involves data formatting, exploratory analysis using visualizations, and deriving insights from the data.


## Technologies Used
+ Python - The programming language used for data analysis.
+ libraries installed
   + NumPy - For numerical operations and array manipulation.
   + Calendar - For handling date-related operations.
   + Pandas - For data manipulation and analysis.
   + Seaborn - For creating informative and attractive visualizations.
   + Matplotlib.pyplot - For additional visualization capabilities.


## Installation
To run the file locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the shopping/ directory
3. Install the required Python packages using the following command:
   
   ```python
   pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib
5. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the shopping_analysis.ipynb notebook to perform data formatting and then proceed to the exploratory analysis.


## Project Walkthrough
1. Import the necessary libraries
2. Load the dataset and take a quick look at the first few rows
3. Check the dimensions and structure of the dataset
4. Handle any duplicate in the dataset
5. Create new columns based on the information of the dataset
6. Convert a column from object to datetime datatype
7. Extracting Date Components into new columns
8. After check the time span covered by the dataset it was decided to focus on a subset of the data
9. Use visualizations to explore the data and answer questions
10. Summarize all the findings
