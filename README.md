## Technologies Used
+ Python - The programming language used for data analysis.
+ NumPy - For numerical operations and array manipulation.
+ Calendar - For handling date-related operations.
+ Pandas - For data manipulation and analysis.
+ Seaborn - For creating informative and attractive visualizations.

## Installation
To run the file locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the shopping/ directory
3. Install the required Python packages using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib
5. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the shopping_analysis.ipynb notebook to perform data formatting and then proceed to the exploratory analysis.

## Usage
The Jupyter notebook guide you through the data preprocessing and exploratory analysis steps. You can run each cell in the notebooks to see the code execution and visualizations.

The insights derived from the analysis are documented at the end of the file.
